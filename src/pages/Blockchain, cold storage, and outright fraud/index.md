What a fantastic event to teach and learn important leasons about blockchain in the real world

DataHarvest was invited to speak at conference of logistics companies.  Many of the companies focused on all things on the water.  Terminals, Shipping lines, Containers, etc.  We met some really nice people that were not sure what to think of blockchain in general yet, but had very open minds and thoughtful comments.  

The Port Authority acted as the hosts and they did a fantastic job featuring the facilities and culture of Valencia

I learned that as an industry, shipping is changing rapidly in the area around data.  There has always been some early adoption but the damn really broke open in the last couple years.

More importantly, I met with many businesses that work on all the links in the chain that ultimately bring products to you.  Many of them are really looking for a way to show how they provide value.  How what they do and how they do it improves or even makes possible at all the conspiracy that made that product appear in front of you.  A great take away for me is that they are all looking for ways to tell their story.  I think we got something for them.
