Kicking things off with Gatsby with Netlify, lets go.

## Testing out this workflow

So far this can't be any easier.  Pulling the demo template and each post will teach you a lot of the format tricks you'll want to use when making cool posts.

*   Agenda items 1 
*   Next itens 
    *   Sub items
*   Final notes ...  slick 

Pretty straight forward text mods like **bold these words up** 

### Cool sub headers 

If you want to embed links it is also very stright forward [take this to Dataharvest](http://dataharvest.co).  Really can't ask for much more.

> Slick little trick to pull and highlight a quote

I will have to recall that it is so easy to fancy this format out.

### Another sub header to call out some simple numbers 

It is sometimes nice to publish a simple list.  

1.  First things first
2.  Something else that is important 
3.  Buy bitcoin

Not always in that order but that is a pretty good list

#### Super small sub header

I will have to play with the layout side but here is a easy way to add images

![Space](./space-badger.jpg)

The only thing I will need is some way to show code samples...oh wait

##### Small sub header about code snipets 

I guess it is as easy as this to add some JavaScript in a native format

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
    console.log('More jQuery, wow!')
})
```
